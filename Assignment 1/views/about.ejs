                <h1>About Assignment 1</h1>
                <p>
                  This assignment represents a basic library system for the
                  WEB422 course. It includes the required book CRUD operations
                  and the endpoints for borrowing and returning books. The
                  assignment uses Express, Mongoose, body-parser, and CORS.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  As per the instructions, there is no authentication of users,
                  as it will be developed in subsequent assignments.
                  Additionally, books can be deleted by anyone due to the lack
                  of authentication. Errors are thrown as responses, console
                  logs, and presented in the UI, such as when a wrong user tries
                  to return or reserve a book, reserving books retroactively, or
                  trying to return a book past the due date. I acknowledge these
                  limitations and aim to fix them in future assignments.

                <p>
                  For the user interface, I used Bootstrap's SnapX theme from
                  <a href="https://themewagon.com/themes/snapx/">SnapX Theme</a
                  >. Some CSS was modified to improve the UI for the assignment.
                  I liked the theme because it resembled a gallery of photos,
                  which I thought could represent a book gallery. I decided to
                  keep the original color scheme because blue is a
                  non-threatening color associated with trust, relaxation, and
                  tranquility. I chose a classic book library theme; therefore,
                  the name is Classic Library Vault. The logo was designed by me
                  to provide a personal touch.
